ðŸ”¸ How Each Folder Works

app/ â†’ Pages & layouts.

context/ â†’ Auth + Theme context.

hooks/ â†’ Reusable hooks (useAuth, useTheme).

lib/ â†’ Axios client setup, helpers.

components/ â†’ Forms, buttons, reusable UI.

middleware.js â†’ Route protection at server side.

This keeps contexts decoupled from components, and scales well when your app grows (e.g. multiple auth flows, dashboards, admin panels).
